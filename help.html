           <div class="help-title">Why do you need confirmations in the Bitcoin system?</div> <br>
            When receiving bitcoins, the recipient cannot immediately use them. Once a transfer is made, 
            it is sent to the Bitcoin network for execution and should be included in a block to be confirmed.
             The process of including the transfer in the found block is called transaction confirmation. 
             Inclusion in 1 block = 1 confirmation, when there are 2 or more such confirmations, the transfer is 
             considered confirmed, and the metka.cc operators, in turn, process the request. 
             This method was introduced to protect against reuse of the same bitcoins. <br>
            <div class="help-title"> How much time do I have to create a request?</div><br>
            You have 15 minutes to create a request. If for some reason you did not have time to create a 
            request during this time, the request disappears automatically. In this case, please create a new request.<br>
            <div class="help-title">I forgot to click the ‘I paid’ button. What to do?</div><br>
            If you forgot to click the ‘I paid’ button, we ask you to write to the technical support chat or our email 
            <a href="https://account.proton.me/uk/login" target="_blank" class="contacts-email">OfficialCoinvision@proton.me</a>. To restore the request you need to provide the request number or email, which 
            you indicated when creating the request.<br>
            <div class="help-title">What to do if I made a mistake in details when creating a request?</div><br>
            In this case, immediately write to the technical support chat asking to cancel the request. If the request is
             being verified or processed, we will be able to correct the details. But if the request is already processed,
              the only thing we can do is provide the details of where your funds went.<br>
            <div class="help-title"></span>How long does it take to process a request?</div><br>
            We try to process your requests as quickly as possible, the processing time on average takes from 5-60 minutes,
             provided that the transfer is made instantly. There are cases of delays in the payment systems, unfortunately, we 
             are unable to speed up such transactions.<br>
            <div class="help-title">I transferred funds but the status of my request is Deleted. What to do?</div><br>
            This situation may be for different reasons. The main thing is to understand that if you paid the request and did
             everything right, there is no reason to worry. First of all, check if you clicked the ‘I paid’ button. Then make sure
              that funds have been debited from your wallet or card. Pay attention to the transfer status. It may be processed or 
              declined. Besides, check the details where you made the transfer to, if they coincide with those, which were provided to you.
             If there are no problems with the transfer and the details are right, please,
             write to the
            Telegram chat <a href="https://t.me/Official_Coinvision" target="_blank" class="contacts-email">@Official_Coinvision</a>
            or email <a href="https://account.proton.me/uk/login" target="_blank" class="contacts-email">OfficialCoinvision@proton.me</a>
